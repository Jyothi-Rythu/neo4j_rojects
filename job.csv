Whilst my client has 10 other offices, Manchester houses the only Permanent Technical Division throughout the country. My client is essentially a 40m turnover Trades Labour Agency and it was the Directors remit when he joined the business in 2010 to establish Permanent Technical division. My client needs someone to come in on day one and work as 360 degree consultant. Someone who is capable of getting on the phone and bringing in requirements, finding candidates, presenting them to clients, arranging interviews and making placements. To support them in this you will have dedicated admin support, access to the likes of Jobsite, Total Jobs, Monster, etc, an inhouse database, the companies UK wide name to sell off and current live clients to target, that you would expect of a 40m construction agency………………. but it is a ‘hands on’ Consultant role. Taking into consideration the difficulties of the current construction recruitment market, it is still a fantastic opportunity for someone to come in grab hold off. Positives of the role include: Sectors  You are not limited to sectors, you can recruit to Main Contractors, Interiors, Building Services, Civil, Engineering Contractors. Roles  You can recruit whatever types of position / role you want and you can recruit permanent and freelance based roles. Geography  You can recruit anywhere in the country with no geographical boundaries or conflicts from other offices. Opportunity  Further down the line (approx 12 months) my client needs someone to build and manage a team based in Manchester and you will not have anyone in your way in the current set up. My clients remit is a national one and once they have the right people in Manchester and Leeds he will then focus on another part of the country. Leads – They do receive more than their fair share of leads / requirements passed from the other offices. There are 10 offices with very sales focused consultants selling to construction and engineering contractors, but they are selling blue collar trades so when they come across perm or technical opportunities they will pass them to this division. I would stress however you can’t rely on these to build your desk. As mentioned above you will need to sell and bring your own business in. There are lots of positives and potential but my client is also realistic. It’s a tough market but I would emphasise they work closely as a team together because it’s in all their interests that they succeed as individuals. Finally I can honestly say my clients employ good people, both in the Manchester office and the other regional offices. The MD, is very supportive and the targets / budgets they are set are very realistic. My client is looking for recruit for this role asap and would ideally have the new person on board by the end of October / beginning November.
